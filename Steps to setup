Step by step how I, Proposed Project:
    1. I installed a Blynk application in my phone phone. 
    2. Once the app is installed and in runnable mode, a project was created using an email address. 
    3. After creating a project, an authorization code is sent to the email address through which the project was linked to the hardware.
    4. Create Labeled value widgets for displaying the Temperature and Humidity values.
    5. Set the pins of Labeled pins in virtual mode and set any pin value as needed.
    6. A History Graph is to be set to show the variance in the values of temperature and humidity.
    7. Set the pins in Graph with the same as the virtual pins that were set to the Labeled values.
    8. To send the data between the hardware and the app we need internet connection like Wi-Fi or mobile hotspot.
